# futil-js

A collection of F(unctional) Util(ities). Resistance is futile.

Mostly, these are generic utilities that could conceivably be part of a library like lodash/fp, but for some reason or other are not.

## Installing

`npm i -S futil-js`

This package require `lodash/fp`, so make sure that's available in your app.
